This gives developers a powerful tool to analyze trends and progress over time, not just a brief snapshot.

## ✨ Features

- 📈 **All-Time Stars History**: Visualize the growth of your repo with an all-time stars history graph.
- 🖥️ **Dashboard Overview**: Easily access a dashboard view for an overview of all your projects.
